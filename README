sphvol.tcl
    Description: Calculates volume elements of spheroid given inputs. This script also defines the shape of the spheroids (clusters) as a function of radius (alpha(r)).
    Input: shells.dat, the a-values defining the spheroids.
    Output: volumes.out, list of the volumes of volume elements as a function of shell number and observation radius.
    
xspecgen.tcl
    Description: Program for generating the xspec script used to make fake spectra. This script also defines the temperature and density -functions for the cluster.
    Input: volumes.out, xspecgen.tcl uses the volumes calculated by sphvol.tcl to make fake mekal spectra of the hot plasma weighted by the volumes. 
    Output: fakemekal.xspec, xspec-code for making fake spectra simulating observations of the cluster.

PS. I take no responsibility for the accidental creation of Earth-consuming black holes as a result of using this code.
