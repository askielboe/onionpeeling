Faking 2-D observations:

First we generate a fake 2-D observation. This is done by selecting a temperature and density and then normalizing the spectra by the volume enclosed in the observation. The volume elements are calculated by the sphvol.tcl script, as a function of shell-number (increasing radially out from the center of the cluster) and observation number (the n=1 observation being only the core of the cluster, and observation n=N only includes the outermost shell, where N is the total number of shells selected for peeling).

In the current version of the script genspectra.tcl (as of Nov 10) the fake spectra are named fm_shelln.fak, where n is the number of the observation.

Onionpeeling:

Now that observed spectra for all the shells have been generated, with normalization equal to the volume of the spectra-generating gas in question, we go on and try to decouple the data once again. This is done by the method of \emph{onionpeeling}.

First we calculate
