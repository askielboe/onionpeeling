sphvol.tcl
    Description: Calculates volume elements of spheroid given inputs. This script also defines the shape of the spheroids (clusters) as a function of radius (alpha(r)).
    Input: shells.dat, the a-values defining the spheroids.
    Output: volumes.out, list of the volumes of volume elements as a function of shell number and observation radius.
    Notes (Nov 9):  The volumes are multiplied by 1000! (line 91).
                    alpha is defined as alpha = b/a (line 10 + others).
    
xspecgen.tcl
    Description: Program for generating the xspec script used to make fake spectra. This script also defines the temperature and density as a function of radius of the cluster.
    Input: volumes.out: using the volumes calculated by sphvol.tcl to make fake mekal spectra of the hot plasma weighted by the volumes. 
    Output: xspecgen_script(1-number of shells).xcm, xspecgen_script.sh, (see below).
    Notes:  The norm is multiplied by 1000 (line 17).
    
xspecgen_script.sh (NOT INCLUDED: auto-generated)
    Description: Shell-script executing generated xspec-code for making fake spectra simulating 2D-observations of the cluster.
    Input: 1666_3.pi, 1666_3.wrmf, 1666_3.warf: Data, response matrix and auxiliary response matrix needed in the 'fakeit' function in xspec.
    
volumes.out
    File with volume of volume elements as a function of shell number and observation.
    Columns are (1 is the innermost):
    Shell no. | Obs no. | Volume
